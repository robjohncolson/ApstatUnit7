Do not modify allUnitsData.js, do not modify any existing file.

Take a look at ALL_UNITS_DATA array @allUnitsData.js   and create a snippet  where the old refernces to the pdf's are replaced with the new standardized filenames.@ls-output.txt 

Create a code snippet where you have an identically formatted block of javascript code as what is in allUnitsData.js.  The code should cover only Unit 7.  Replace all unit 7 pdf filename references with the new ones.  Output the code snippet.

@index.html  is based on unit3 material, but the material we have is for unit 7.  @knowledge-tree.md 

Please replace all references of Unit 3 to unit 7.

Restrict modifcations to index.html!

unit 7's AP exam weight is 10-18%

Now let's focus on capstone in @index.html.  The buttons gotta match where they head to.  if the button is mated to an FRQ answer, let the button express that.  If it's mated to an MCQ part A answer, let it say that!

Focus only on index.html
