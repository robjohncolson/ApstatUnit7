Objective: Convert the current AP Statistics Unit 6 `index.html` file into a functional `index.html` file for Unit 7 (Inference for Quantitative Data: Means), maintaining a self-contained, monolithic structure.

Source File: `index.html` (The current file, containing Unit 6 code and data)
Target File: `index.html` (This same file, to be modified for Unit 7)
Reference Files (For YOUR manual data input later): `knowledge-tree.md`, `js/allUnitsData.js`, verify Unit 7 PDF paths in your `pdfs/unit7/` directory.

Please perform the following modifications within this file:

1.  **Update Unit ID Constant:**
    *   Find the line: `const UNIT_ID = '6';`
    *   Change it to: `const UNIT_ID = '7';`

2.  **Update Static HTML Content:**
    *   Change the `<title>` tag content from "Unit 6: Inference for Categorical Data: Proportions" to: `AP Statistics Unit 7: Inference for Quantitative Data: Means`.
    *   Change the main `<h1>` heading content from "Unit 6: Inference for Categorical Data: Proportions" to: `AP Statistics Unit 7: Inference for Quantitative Data: Means`.
    *   Update the exam weight text (in the `div` with `bg-yellow-100`) to reflect Unit 7's weight (e.g., "Unit 7 represents 10-18% of the AP Statistics Exam", adjust % as needed based on your `UnitWeights.pdf` or syllabus).

3.  **Prepare Topic Data Area for Manual Replacement:**
    *   Locate the start of the `const pdfFiles = [` array definition (around line 980, currently holding Unit 6 data).
    *   **Delete all the topic objects** currently inside the square brackets `[]`, from the first `{` representing Topic 6.1 down to the last `}` representing the Unit 6 capstone.
    *   Leave the code as: `const pdfFiles = [ /* USER: PASTE UNIT 7 TOPIC DATA HERE */ ];`
    *   *(Action Required By User (You): After Claude runs, you MUST manually paste the complete JavaScript array data for Unit 7's topics into this empty array definition. Ensure all topic `id`s are "7-n", `name`s are "Topic 7.n", descriptions match Unit 7, video URLs are correct for Unit 7, `quizId`s are "7-n_q1", and `questionPdf`/`answersPdf` paths correctly use `pdfs/unit7/`)*

4.  **Verify Local Storage Key Usage:** (No change expected)
    *   Confirm `loadTopicProgress` and `saveTopicProgress` use `UNIT_ID`.

5.  **Verify Supabase `unit_id` Usage:** (No change expected)
    *   Confirm `saveCompletionToSupabase` and `deleteCompletionFromSupabase` use `UNIT_ID`.

**Summary of Manual Step:**
The most important step **after** running this prompt is for **you** to manually populate the `const pdfFiles = []` array with the correct, complete topic data for **Unit 7**, ensuring all IDs, names, descriptions, video URLs, quiz IDs, and PDF paths (using `pdfs/unit7/`) are accurate for Unit 7.
